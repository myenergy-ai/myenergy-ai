# Contributing to myenergy-ai

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

##### Note: Make sure you remove irrelavent imports and console logs. If not, it may lead to errors while performing [Github Actions](https://github.com/myenergy-ai/myenergy-ai/actions).

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/myenergy-ai/myenergy-ai/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

[This is the template](https://gist.github.com/carlo/3402842) of a bug report. Here's [another example from Andreas Larsen](https://gist.github.com/larsenwork/3f92a3adf79838abd7d6b15c5b74f7b0), an Frontend fanatic, type tinkerer, speaker supreme and open source optimist.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. [My stackoverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/q/12488905/180626) includes sample code that _anyone_ with a base R setup can run to reproduce what I was seeing
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

- Naming Convention
  - File, class, variable and functions must follow camcel-case format.
  - CSS classnames must be according to [BEM naming](http://getbem.com/naming/).
- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- Use [Ant Design](https://ant.design/) principles for designing.
- Try to put the logic outside the component.
